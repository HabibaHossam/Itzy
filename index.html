            <P>Yeji (예지) is a South Korean rapper and singer under JYP Entertainment. She is the leader, main dancer, lead vocalist and sub rapper of South Korean girl group ITZY. My bias because who wouldn't bias her she's so stunning but also extremly hard working and she's sp passionate about what she does. She was a trainee at JYP for 3 years before debuting. She's actually pretty tall, 170cm so if i stand next to her i'd be invisable ngl. She also looks like the humanification of toothless from "How to train your dragon". Although she's the leader and the oldest member, the other members always tease her especially when she messes up in her speeches, which surprisingly happened more that once. Yeji's mbti is ISFJ which means she's introverted, focused on facts, ruled by her heart, and likes to be well-prepared, kinda means she is a true born leader,, so true bffie!!.</P>

            <p>Ryujin (류진) is a South Korean singer, rapper, and dancer under JYP Entertainment. She is the main rapper, a lead dancer, a sub-vocalist, and the center of South Korean girl group ITZY. Ryujin is an extremly amazing dancer and she has insane stage presance. Also she literally got casted at a GOT7 fanmeeting and she only gave her number to the JYP scouter because she thought she was pretty so if that doesn't scream... i don't know what will, that is one of the many reasons as to why ryujin is mt second bias. Ryujin is kind of the “guy”, girl crush of the group. She was also offered a position in YG by  Yang Hyun Suk, but she chose to stay at JYP, and as much as i hate JYP im glad she stayed with itzy, anyways that goes to show that ryu is an ace and anyone would be lucky to have her at their company. Her mbti type is INTJ, meaning she’s introverted, focused on possibilities, ruled by her head, and likes to be well-prepared.</p>

            <p>Yuna (유나) is a South Korean member of girl group ITZY under JYP Entertainment. Stage Name: Yuna (유나) Birth Name: Shin Yuna (신유나) English Name: Hussey Shin. Birthday: December 9, 2003. Genuinely can't believe she's younger than me, given only by a year but still. Although her being the youngest member she's also the tallest and has also had 3 years of training at JYP. She's so smiley its adorable, her debut fancam went viral in korea and with k-fans because she just looked likr she was having the time of her life in it even though everyone expected that they'll all be nervous on their debut stage, i know i would be ngl. Yuna made a small cameo in BTS-Love yourself highlight reel along side Ryujin. Yuna's mbti is ENFJ, meaning they’re extroverted, focused on possibilities, ruled by their hearts, and likes to be well-prepared. She shares her mbti with lia, another itzy member, but also with people like obama and oprah thus proving the fact that yuna>>>> </p>

            <p>Itzy (stylized as ITZY; Korean: 있지; RR: Itji) is a South Korean girl group formed by JYP Entertainment, consisting of members Yeji, Lia, Ryujin, Chaeryeong, and Yuna. The group debuted on February 12, 2019, with the release of their single album, It'z Different. The group's commercial success has led to them earning several new artist of the year awards, including Rookie of the Year at the 34th Golden Disc Awards and Best New Female artist at the 2019 Melon Music Awards and the 2019 Mnet Asian Music Awards. On March 20, Itzy released the digital single "Trust Me (Midzy)", a song dedicated to their fans, as part of their first global livestream event. On April 30, Itzy released their fourth EP Guess Who and its lead single "In the Morning". On May 11, the EP entered into the Billboard 200 at number 148, making it their first appearance into the list. The English version of "In the Morning" was released on May 14. Stream their newest album "GUESS WHO" because although they're still fairly new they're absoloutly dominating the kpop industry, i am not biased at all what-so-ever, they also performed 'Mafia in the Morning' and 'Sorry not Sorry' in suits multiple time and it's honestly a blessing.</p>
